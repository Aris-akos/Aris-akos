# R Programming Language

R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. Created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is also used for data mining, bioinformatics, and data analysis.

## History

The language was inspired by the S programming language, with most S programs able to run unaltered in R. The language was also inspired by Scheme's lexical scoping, allowing for local variables.

## Programming

- **Object:** R stores data inside an object.
  
- **Vector:** The most primitive R object is the vector.
  
- **Data frame:** A data frame stores a two dimensional array of vectors.
  
- **Functions:** A function is an object that stores computer code instead of data.
